# Delta Robot Kinematic with TwinCAT & 3D Simulation in OpenGL C#

- In this study, the materials coming from the conveyor line will be taken from the conveyor line by using a delta robot arm and placed in the desired position as required by the process.

- A software was implemented to perform the 3D simulation of this system. Thus, the real-time movements of the system are followed by the user through this simulation program.

- "OpenGL_Deneme.rar" in this file you can find C# Codes for the simulation also you can find TwinCAT codes in "TC3_deltarobotprojects.rar" file.
